square distance is good for ordering and speed
because d < e is will true for d^2 < e^2
distance is good for actual similarity scales
distance is nothing but resultant magnitude
squared distance exaggerates differences so its good for heavily punishing errors.
Imagine a taxi in Manhattan (a grid-like city).
You can’t go diagonally — only horizontal + vertical paths.
So instead of “straight line distance” (Euclidean), you measure:
how far sideways +
how far up/down
you need to go.
That’s why it’s called Manhattan or Taxicab distance.
So, if you draw all vectors whose Euclidean distance = constant, you get a circle.
For manhattan if you plot in 2d such that manhattan distance is same, it will form a diamond pattern it wont a curve because its an absolute
difference between coordinates
