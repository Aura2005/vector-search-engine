Requirement:
Input string -> search for similar **meaning** string -> get the result
basically a search engine

Looking for types of search engine:
a. Vector Search engine (uses vector embedding to represent data)
b. Traditional Keyword based (keyword matching and ranking algorithms)
c. ANN search (Approximate Nearest Neightbour) (Real world vector search engine rely on ANN mostly)
and so on...

Final decision:
**Vector Search Engine**

Understanding the working flow of Vector Search Engine
Input string -> convert to vector -> apply similarility checks with every existing vectors -> fetch the id -> get the result

At the moment input will restricted to String (highly flexible)
convert to vector -> requires open source text embeddings

Looking for open source text embeddings
Google: "list of all the open source text embedding models free (string to vectors) java"
List:
    Sentence Transformer Models (all-minilm-l6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2)
    BAAI general embedding (multilingual support)
    and a lot more

For now we are fine with English input only so **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** for text embedding

how to integrate this model?
    Libraries:
    a. LangChain4j
    b. DLJ (Deep Java Library)

Sticking with DJL, has really good documentation (though felt they lacked proper example implementations but overall its good)

now how do I add this pretrained model 'all-MiniLM-l6-v2' hmm in the project?
Google Search: "how to use all-minilm-l6-v2 in java using DJL library"
Really appreciate this the first person's reference:
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76277911/how-to-use-pretrained-hugging-face-all-minilm-l6-v2-mode-using-java-deep-java-li"
"https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl-demo/blob/master/huggingface/nlp/src/main/java/com/examples/TextEmbedding.java" this is what I actually
needed to set up all-minilm-l6-v2 model.

Testing out the example in the project
EmbeddingTest.java

Problem: How to import the DJL library in the project in order to use its packages.
okay it was quite easier to do, just add implementations in build.gradle dependencies

djl && djl-demo (for examples) github
